    " Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.   In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline  to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from the table in Task 12 above, all machine learning models produced the same test accuracy, apart from the decision tree (DT) model. Indicating that they perform reasonably well in terms of predictive accuracy on the test/ unseen data, with the tree model performing slightly better. Accuracy is 0.94 and F1 score is 0.96, on the unseen/ test data. Partly due to the DT model's false positives and false negatives having a similar cost (refer to the Decision Tree Confusion matrix in Task 9 above).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also consider other evaluation metrics or criteria to determine the best model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-validation performance**: Instead of relying solely on the test accuracy, we can perform cross-validation to assess the models' performance across multiple train-test splits. We performed this by utilising GridSearchCV above.  This provides a more robust estimation of their generalization performance and helps identify any variations in performance across different data subsets - in this instance (and as can be seen from the multiple bar chart above), the decision tree classifier is the best model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretability**: We can consider the interpretability of the models. Some models, such as decision trees or linear models, provide more interpretable results compared to complex models like neural networks or ensemble methods. In our case, the Logistic Regression and Decision tree are considered interpretable, unlike SVM and KNN. And the higher the interpretability of a machine learning model, the easier it is for someone to comprehend why certain decisions or predictions have been made. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**: In general we lack test data, as we only have 18 test samples to work with.  Hence, the test dataset is an unrepresentative sample of data from the domain. Possibly a reason why all the test accuracies are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the evaluation metrics and criteria may vary depending on our specific problem, data, and objectives of our project. Therefore, it is recommended to consider a combination of metrics and criteria to make an informed decision about the best model, taking into account our specific requirements and constraints.  In our case, **the decision tree method/ model performs the best**, when we take into consideration both accuracy and F1 Score (other evaluation metrics or criteria). \n"
